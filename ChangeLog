	* Following Rob's suggestions, icd9 codes 296.2, 296.3, and
	296.5 were moved from Psychosis to Depression. The original
	cmbd.csv extracted from arhq website was renamed to cmbd-arhq.csv.
	The sysdata.rda has been regenerated with the updated cmbd.csv.
	A better solution would be to keep several versions of the
	comobidity definitions, and the users can select which one to use.

	* A new function in codeine is used to extract icd-9 and drg 
	code from arhq website. The sysdata.rda has been regenerated 
	with the updated icd-9 and drg code from icd.txt and drg.txt file.
	And we keep urls of the arhq website or several versions of the 
	comorbidity definitions in sas-url.txt file in codeGen folder. 
	And the users can select which one to use (use the urls and format 
	code.R to generate the comorbidity code)
	
	* We exported a icdPrep function. This function is used to clean 
	the data with format of touch package. Then the cleaned data can 
	satisfy the input format of arhq SAS program. 
	A better way is using the raw data with correct comorbidity code
	so that the output of the touch package is the same as that of SAS code.
